In computing, the word script is used to refer to a file containing a logical sequence of orders or a batch processing file. This is 
usually a simple program, stored in a plain text file.

Scripts are always processed by some kind of interpreter, which is responsible for executing each command sequentially.

A plain text file containing Python code that is intended to be directly executed by the user is usually called **script**, which is an 
informal term that means **top-level program file**.

On the other hand, a plain text file, which contains Python code that is designed to be imported and used from another Python file, is 
called **module**.

So, the main difference between a module and a script is that **modules are meant to be imported**, while **scripts are made to be 
directly executed**.

In either case, the important thing is to know how to run the Python code you write into your modules and scripts.
