The for statement is most commonly used. It loops over the elements of a sequence, assigning each to the loop variable.
A simple example:
```python
for ...:
    if ...:
        try:
        except:
    else:
```
As you can see, 



MAPS:
You can think of map as a for moved into C code. The only restriction is that the "loop body" of map must be a function call.
