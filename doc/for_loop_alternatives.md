# 1. You (Probably) Don't need For-Loops
The for statement is most commonly used. It loops over the elements of a sequence, assigning each to the loop variable.  
Looping over Python arrays, lists, or dictionaries, can be slow. Fortunately, there are already great tools that are built into Python to help you accomplish speeding up your code! 



MAPS:
You can think of map as a for moved into C code. The only restriction is that the "loop body" of map must be a function call.
