# Calling a C library
Python bindings allow you to call functions and pass data from Python to C, letting you take advantage of the strengths of both languages.

# Why call C from Python
There are several situations where creating Python bindings to call a C library is a great idea:
- You already have a large, tested, stable library written in C
- You want to speed up a particular section of your Python code
- You want to use Python test tools
